# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Trimly**, a Logic Weaver project. We welcome pull requests, issues, and ideas — as long as they push the project forward with clarity and quality.

## Code of Conduct

Please make sure to review and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**

   Create your own fork of the repository and clone it locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LogicWeave/trimly.git
   cd trimly
   ```

2. **Create a new branch**

   Create a new branch for your feature, changes or bugfix
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**

   Write clean, idiomatic code that fits the project’s structure and style. Follow naming and architectural conventions. If your changes introduce new behavior, add relevant tests. Avoid dead code, shortcuts, or casual “test” commits—everything you push should be production-worthy.
   
4. **Test your changes thoroughly**

   Before submitting anything, test your changes locally in an environment that reflects production. Cover all edge cases and failure scenarios—not just the happy path. If your change touches UI or performance, do a manual check too. Your PR should reflect a fully verified state.

5. **Submit a pull request**

   Open a PR against the main branch with a clear, focused summary. Explain what changed and why, linking any related issues. Keep commits clean and organized. Good context helps reviewers understand your intent and makes the process smoother for everyone.

## PR Guidelines

- Keep pull requests focused and minimal
- Include a short summary of what you’ve changed
- Feel free to open a Draft PR early for discussion or feedback
- Always test your UI changes before submitting

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug:

1. Open a GitHub issue
2. Describe what went wrong and steps to reproduce it
3. Include the OS, Python version, FFmpeg version, etc.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for questions or discussions about potential contributions.

## How It Works

Trimly uses FFmpeg‚Äôs `silenceremove` filter to analyze and remove silent parts from your audio. You control how silence is detected with:

- **Silence Threshold (dB)** ‚Äì How quiet a segment must be to count as silence
- **Min Silence Duration (sec)** ‚Äì How long a pause must be before trimming kicks in

The result? Cleaner, tighter audio ‚Äî instantly.

## How It Works

Trimly uses FFmpeg‚Äôs `silenceremove` filter to detect and trim silent segments. You control how it behaves:

- **Silence Threshold (dB)**: How quiet is ‚Äúsilent‚Äù?
- **Minimum Silence Duration (sec)**: How long before it gets chopped?

This lets you remove awkward gaps from voiceovers with surgical precision.
